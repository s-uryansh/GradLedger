# Bindings
This dir has all the binding of Smart Contracts.

## What are bindings:
These are basically code version of smart contracts. A normal backend can't directly call smart contract so binding help backend call the smart contract functions.

> Important:
> Smart contracts should be running in order to use this backend. If smart contracts are down or not runnning backend will fail.
